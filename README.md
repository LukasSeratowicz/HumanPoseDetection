You can try my Demo at:
https://github.com/LukasSeratowicz/HumanPoseDetectionDemo

This Project builds on that idea implementing:
- Image to Image
- Video to Video
- Webcam Live
- Everything is embedded within Web UI using Gradio, similar to AUTOMATIC1111 for Stable Diffusion
- On top of that if I will have anough time, i will cover and add an API as well as Unity Script for example usage

Feel Free to follow for any updates!
